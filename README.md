### Hi, my name is Brian Hambleton 
#### I like creating things, learning how stuff works, and figuring out how to break stuff (probably safely).

I enjoy using my creativity and technical knowledge and abilities to solve a variety of problems requiring a wide range of solutions, including:
 * software development (mobile, web, and desktop apps, data structures, algorithms)
 * computer security and forensics (reverse engineering a binary blob, malware analysis and identification)
 * multimedia content creation 

When I'm not on a computer, I love exploring all the things our world has to offer.

:bulb: Currently learning: more data structures and algorithms (interview prep) and *wanting to learn Go*

:denmark: I am currently learning Danish *Hej, taler du Dansk?*

:book: Currently reading: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell 

**Here you'll find some projects that I have worked on as I learn (indefinitely) about the world of computer programming.**
