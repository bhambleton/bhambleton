### Hi, my name is Brian Hambleton 
![Various pictures I've taken, or had taken of me from various locations.](https://github.com/bhambleton/bhambleton/raw/master/cover-photo.jpg)
#### I like creating things, learning how stuff works, and figuring out how to break stuff (probably safely). When I'm not on a computer, I love exploring all the things our world has to offer.

I enjoy using my technical knowledge and skills as well as my creativity to solve a variety of problems requiring a wide range of solutions, including: software development, computer security and forensics, and multimedia content creation.

  :book: Currently reading: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
