### Hi, my name is Brian Hambleton 
![Various pictures I've taken, or had taken of me from various locations.](https://github.com/bhambleton/bhambleton/raw/master/cover-photo.jpg)
#### I like creating things, learning how stuff works, and figuring out how to break stuff (probably safely). When I'm not on a computer, I love exploring all the things our world has to offer.


I enjoy using my creativity and technical knowledge and abilities to solve a variety of problems requiring a wide range of solutions, including: software development, computer security and forensics, and multimedia content creation. 

:bulb: Currently learning: more data structures and algorithms (interview prep) and *wanting to learn Go*

:denmark: I am currently learning Danish *Hej, taler du Dansk?*

:book: Currently reading: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell 

*Check out some of the projects I have worked on as I learn (indefinitely) about computer systems and their software.*
